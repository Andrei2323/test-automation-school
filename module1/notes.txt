* Best Practices - driver should be put under resources together with src
*         //NOTE - you have to indicate all class names that are specified on the current element
          // This is contrary to CSS Selector where you can specify just one of the class names
* understand that it is not necessary to write
  WebElement elementById = driver.findElement(By.id("search_query_top"));
  elementById.click();
and you can just chain:
driver.findElement(By.name("q")).click();
* understand that it is possible to assign object reference to a variable which it the interface, whichis implemented by the object`s class
or assign to parent class, which is extended by the object`s class
or assign to abstract parent class, which is extended by the object`s class


* Closing browsers - in AfterMethod or in AfetrClass. also discuss in parallel execution - not possible run parallel if AfterClass is used.

So if you find yourself with a test suite that hard to maintain,  slow, frequently broken - stop. Think about what are you doing,. Why you are doing this. Could we replicate this level of confidence with smaller tests

only e2e. not all tests need to be Selenium!


"Implicit waits are terrible mistake I have made and I apologize for them!"

Avoid using implicit wait if you possible can, especcialy with Explicit waits


Implicit wait - if  you ask for an element and it`s not there, we`ll wait a little bit in case it`s about to arrive and we handed to you




Page Objects - dont auto generate page objects. Thinks about what they are for
They are for to:
1. Model services that  your pages or components of pages offer
2. Make your tests clearer and easier to maintain

Rule of thumb - don`t expose selenium api`s from it
