* Best Practices - driver should be put under resources together with src
*         //NOTE - you have to indicate all class names that are specified on the current element
          // This is contrary to CSS Selector where you can specify just one of the class names
* understand that it is not necessary to write
  WebElement elementById = driver.findElement(By.id("search_query_top"));
  elementById.click();
and you can just chain:
driver.findElement(By.name("q")).click();
* understand that it is possible to assign object reference to a variable which it the interface, whichis implemented by the object`s class
or assign to parent class, which is extended by the object`s class
or assign to abstract parent class, which is extended by the object`s class


* Closing browsers - in AfterMethod or in AfetrClass. also discuss in parallel execution - not possible run parallel if AfterClass is used.
